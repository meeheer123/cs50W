To start the project we need the command:
django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME

To run the project:
python manage.py runserver

To make an application:
python manage.py startapp APP_NAME

every django projects has one or more django applications

manage.py --> execute commands on the project
settings.py --> contains important configuration settings
urls.py --> table of contents [table of routes]
views.py --> this is where we write our functions (for app)


Things to do after creating app:
1. go to settings.py of project and under installed apps add the APP_NAME
2. go inside urls.py of project and add path('APP_NAME/', include("APP_NAME.urls))
3. go to the app and create urls.py file with contents:
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views
    urlpatterns = [
        path("DESIRED_PATH", views.FUNCTION_NAME, name="NAME"),
    ]
4. go to views.py of app and create a function which takes request as parameter
